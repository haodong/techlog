1. In the `RemoteInstall\Boot\x64` folder, move `wdsmgfw.efi` out (or rename as `wdsmgfw.efi.old`).
2. Make a copy of "bootmgfw.efi" and rename it to "wdsmgfw.efi".

## Kill a stucked Hyper-V VM
1. Safe Way
`Get-Service vmms | Restart-Service`
This will not hurt any VM.
2. Force Way
    - Open Powershell
    - Let's say **SVM-GUARDEDHOST1** is the name of the virtual machine.
    ```powershell
    $VMGUID = (Get-VM "SVM-GUARDEDHOST1").ID
    $VMWMProc = (Get-WmiObject Win32_Process | ? {$_.Name -match 'VMWP' -and $_.CommandLine -match $VMGUID})
    Stop-Process ($VMWMProc.ProcessId) –Force
    ```

## Add Visualization Support to install RDS Role
1. Enable Virtualization Extensions on the vCPU
  ```powershell
  Set-VMProcessor -VMName “servername” -ExposeVirtualizationExtensions $true
  ```
2. Enable MAC Address Spoofing
